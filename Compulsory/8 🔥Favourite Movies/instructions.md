### Challenge: ðŸ”¥Find a Movie by Index

Imagine you have a list of your all-time favorite movies, and you want to quickly find out which movie is at a specific position in the list. In this challenge, you'll create a function that does just that!

## â›³ Scenario

You have an array that stores your favorite movies in a specific order. Your task is to create a function that takes an index as an argument and returns the movie at that index. However, if the index is out of bounds (i.e., it doesnâ€™t exist in the array), the function should return a message saying the index is invalid.

### Example Inputs and Outputs

```javascript
// == Example 1 ==
// console.log(getMovieByIndex(2)) = "The movie at index 2 is 'Inception'"

// == Example 2 ==
// console.log(getMovieByIndex(5)) = "Invalid index. Please provide a valid index."
```

## âœ… Task

1. **Create an Array of Favorite Movies**
   - Start by creating an array that contains at least 4 of your favorite movies.

2. **Write a Function to Find the Movie by Index**
   - The function should take one parameter (the index) and return the movie at that index.
   - If the index is invalid (either negative or greater than the array length), return an appropriate message.

## ðŸ§  Hints

For the best learning experience, try solving the challenge using just the requirements and understanding the inputs and outputs. Refer to the hints only if needed.

<details>
<summary>Hint 1</summary>
Remember that arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index `0`.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Hint 2</summary>
Use an `if` statement to check if the index is within the valid range before trying to access the movie.
</details>

<br>

<details>
<summary>Hint 3</summary>
The length of the array can help you determine the valid range for indices.

## âš¡ Pseudocode Solution

<summary>Pseudocode</summary>

```
1. Create an array named favoriteMovies with at least 4 movie titles.

2. Write a function named getMovieByIndex that accepts one parameter (index).

3. Inside the function:
    a. Check if the index is valid (i.e., greater than or equal to 0 and less than the length of the array).
    b. If valid, return the movie at the given index.
    c. If not valid, return a message saying "Invalid index. Please provide a valid index."

4. Test the function with different index values to ensure it works correctly.
